           <p id="left">The Reversing Unit (REV UNIT) is designed for use with sprint 400, 800 and 1200 drives. It is a robust design for safe reversal from any speed. It is suitable for any armature voltage up to 180v dc, no additional contactors or relays required. The card possesses all the necessary logic and unlike other available units, all the contactors for reversing and dynamic braking are integral to the unit.</p>
