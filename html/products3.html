                  <h1>1Q CONTROL FOR DC MOTORS</h1>
                  <p>The DC Drives with Enclosures provide a more advanced 1Q control option for motors rated up to 3.7/4/8/12Amps output current (0.37 up to 1.8kW motor power). The 370E, 400E, 800E, 1200E, 400ER, 800ER, 1200ER DC Drive enclosures are available with 110-240VAC input as standard (and an optional 30-60VAC low voltage option providing 24 – 48VDC output). Models include:- IP40 protection, mains on/off switch, dual voltage supply, fully fused, zero speed interlocked reversing(ER only), dynamic braking (ER Only), set speed potentiometer with graduated scale. The 400/800/1200 E & ER models feature the Sprint micro analog processor which provides many user benefits normally only seen in expensive “high end” products.</p>
